# Capstone

A Camera Application written in Swift, that tracks a specified object and keeps target centered in frame through the use of a Camera Gimbal.
The repository contains code for a camera app implementing Apple's Vision Kit and our own frame/pixel mapping techniques to track an object
in real time during recording sessions. With the help of a motor driven gimbal we are able to track a dynamic object over a wide field of view.
An image of what the app would look like when deployed:
